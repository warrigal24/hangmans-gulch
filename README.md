# Hangman's Gulch

By Garry Francis

## Background

On 24 January 1848, James Marshall discovered gold at Sutter's Mill, Coloma. When news spread, thousands flocked to the area and the great Californian gold rush began.

Mining camps popped up all over the place and some of these developed into townships. When the gold rush died down, some of these towns were abandoned just as quickly as they had appeared.

You're a grizzled old prospector who's down on his luck. You haven't found any gold in weeks and your supplies have dwindled to practically nothing, so you decide to head to town. When you get there, you find that the town has been abandoned. What can you do?

You can't survive without supplies and the next town is miles away. Enough is enough. You know when you're beaten. You decide to return back home, but first, you'll need to scavenge the town for *treasures* to fund the trip.

This is a traditional text adventure based on 'Hangtown' by John H Doolittle. The game is hosted at [Hangman's Gulch](https://drdooriddle.itch.io/hangmans-gulch).
